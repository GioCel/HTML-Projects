# HTML-Projects

This is the [first project](https://github.com/GioCel/HTML-Projects/blob/main/Project1.html) I have made using HTML.
It is a simple project but nevertheless, it teaches the very basic concepts of HTML.
Very exciting to be on this journey.

This is my [second project](https://github.com/GioCel/HTML-Projects/blob/main/Internal%20Links%20Exercise.html).
In this project, I explore the use of Favicons and Internal Links.

This is my [third project](https://github.com/GioCel/HTML-Projects/blob/main/Table.html).
A very good friend gave me the challenge to create a simple table with a few items, so I did that and also used 'style'.
